function ov = wz_sample(vec, ns, re, nr)
% take <ns> random samples from input vector, <vec> with replacement (<re> = 1)
% or without (<re> = 0, default). 
% If <ns> is equal or larger than length(vec)). If only <vec> is provided 
% a bootstrap sample will be returned, i.e. a vector of the same length as <vec>
% with samples drawn with replacement (<re> = 1).
%
% <nr> specifies the number of samples drawn from <vec>. Note. if ns has
% two elements, the second one will be used as <nr>.
%
% Currently, it is assumed that the input is a row vector. 
% Thus, if nr > 1 the rows are the the <nr> samples. 
%
% This function is inspired by the sample function of the R package.
% (ok, Matlab provides now the randsample function that has a similar functionality but much slower.)
%
% ToDo: use a weighted sampling by allowing another vector defining the probability of each element.
