Supplemental Material - Gondan (2009)This zip file contains a script in R statistical programming language (R Development Core Team, 2009) and a MATLAB script (R2007b, The MathWorks, Munich, Germany), as well as usage instructions and example data from a redundant target experiment (Gondan et al., 2004):¥ rmiperm.r: R script for the permutation test¥ rmiperm.m: Matlab script¥ go2004.dat: ASCII file with example data from Gondan et al. (2004)In the scripts, it is assumed that these files have been downloaded to the local folder C:\RTDATA. The current version of R for Windows and other operating systems can be downloaded from http://www.r-project.org/, in general, Windows users download the binary package of the program.After installation of the R program, "Open Script..." can be chosen from the "File" menu to open rmiperm.r which contains the code for the permutation test. The entire script is run by choosing "Execute all" from the "Edit" menu, thereby analyzing the example data (C:\RTDATA\go2004.dat). This path can be modified to point to the correct results file. The results file should be in tab-delimited ASCII text format and should include the three following columns:¥ obs: observer number¥ cond: condition (A, V, AV)¥ rt: response time in Milliseconds, with omitted responses coded as "Inf"The three column names should be included as the header of the results file, thus, the first few lines of the results file look like:obs cond   rt  1    A  245  1    V  281  1   AV  212  1    V  InfIf default options are used, the command rmi_perm performs a permutation test using the quantiles .05, .10, .15, .20, .25, .30 of the entire response time distribution. By default, 10001 permutations are used to generate the distribution of the tmax statistic under the race model assumption. These default options can be adjusted using the following arguments:¥ q: quantiles to be used for the test, default: .05, .10, .15, .20, .25, .30¥ nperm: number of permutations used for determining the distribution of tmax under the race model. Use an odd number like 1001 or 10001 (default) to avoid P values corresponding exactly to 0.05.The return value is a list with two elements, the observed tmax statistic and one-sided P value. Significant P values indicate a violation of the race model. Functions, arguments, defaults and return value of the Matlab script (rmiperm.m) are identical to those of the R script.
